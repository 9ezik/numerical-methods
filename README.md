## Labs

- [х] 1 -> Solve a system of three linear equations with three variables using the [Gaussian method](https://github.com/9ezik/numerical-methods/blob/main/gauss.js)
- [х] 2 -> Solve a system of four linear equations with four variables by the method of [simple iterations](https://github.com/9ezik/numerical-methods/blob/main/simple-iterations.js)
- [х] 3 -> Solve a non-linear equation using three methods of [segment cutting](https://github.com/9ezik/numerical-methods/blob/main/cutting-segments.js) - the dichotomy method, the Fibonacci method, the golden section method
- [х] 4, 5 -> Finding the [interpolation function](https://github.com/9ezik/numerical-methods/blob/main/Interpolation-approximation.js) using the Lagrange polynomial and finding the approximation function using polynomials of the first and second degree. The choice of the best polynomial should be substantiated using the method of least squares.
- [х] 6 -> [Numerical integration](https://github.com/9ezik/numerical-methods/blob/main/numerical-integration.js): find the approximate value of the definite integral using the methods of rectangles, trapezoids and Simpson
- [х] 7 -> [Differential equations](https://github.com/9ezik/numerical-methods/blob/main/differential-equations.js): solve the Cauchy problem using the Euler and Runge-Kutt methods
